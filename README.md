## 🔧 Configuration

### SEO & Social
Update meta tags in `index.html` `<head>`:
- `description`, `keywords`, `author`
- Open Graph (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`)
- Twitter Card (`twitter:card`, `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`)
- Favicon: replace `images/favicon.ico`

### Google Maps (optional)
`index.html` includes a Google Maps script tag. Replace the API key with your own or remove the script if you don’t need the map:

```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&sensor=false"></script>
```

### Brand & Colors
- Edit CSS variables in `css/enhancements.css` (primary gold, typography, shadows)
- Swap images in `images/` to match your brand

---

## � How to Run Tests (Manual)

This is a static site. Validate quickly by:
- Open `index.html` and check that the loader disappears within 1–2s
- Verify hero text is visible on all slides
- Submit the booking form (try invalid → errors; valid → success toast)
- Click “Add to Cart” on products — counter should increment and persist

---

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

### Page stuck on loading
- We ship a guard that hides the loader within 2s (`js/loader-fix.js`)
- See `md/LOADER_FIX_GUIDE.md` if the spinner doesn’t disappear

### Text not visible on hero/images
- We include a safety stylesheet: `css/text-visibility-fix.css`
- See `md/TEXT_FIX_GUIDE.md` for diagnostics and emergency overrides

### Want the classic look back?
- Temporarily comment these in `index.html` to revert extras:
  - `css/enhancements.css`, `css/mobile-responsive.css`
  - `js/enhancements.js`, `js/loader-fix.js`

---

## ♿ Accessibility & ♻️ Performance

- Focus styles, keyboardable popups, larger touch targets
- Reduced‑motion, high‑contrast, and dark‑mode accommodations
- Lazy loading via IntersectionObserver, simplified shadows on mobile

---

## 📦 Deployment

Any static host works:
- GitHub Pages: push `main` → enable Pages
- Netlify/Vercel: import repo → deploy as static site

---

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
2. Keep changes scoped; prefer minimal, readable diffs
3. Open a PR describing motivation, screenshots, and testing notes
